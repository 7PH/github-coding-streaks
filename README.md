# GitHub Coding Streaks

This project aims to celebrate and motivate continuous coding efforts by ranking GitHub users based on their commit history. We provide three unique leaderboards to highlight different aspects of coding dedication.

## Leaderboards

1. **Weekly Commit Streak**: Celebrating those with the most consecutive weeks of commits, encouraging regular contributions.
1. **Daily Commit Streak**: Recognizing users with the longest daily commit streak. Who needs time off anyway?
1. **Top Contributor**: Honoring the dedication of users with the highest number of contributions in the past year.

## All leaderboards
